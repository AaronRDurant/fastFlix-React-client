# fastFlix-client

As the client-side of a MERN stack web application, this React project sources data from the fastFlix-backend REST API. It allows users to view some of the most popular racing-themed movies of all time, make an account, and curate a list of their favorite films.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build for development

```bash
parcel [path to index.html]
```

_Default path to index.html is 'src/index.html'_

```bash
parcel src/index.html
```

**Note:** If you don't have parcel installed globally, your terminal will report that the command 'parcel' is not found. If this is the case, simply follow the instructions on [how to install parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html).

### Run application in browser

Parcel will run a local server on port 1234.

Open the application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:1234/
```
